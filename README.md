# Voices Unheard Documentation

A secure digital platform designed as a safe space for individuals affected by conflict—including war victims, refugees, and discrimination survivors—to share their stories anonymously.

## 🎯 Mission

Creating a digital sanctuary that combines absolute technical security with professional content moderation, enabling vulnerable voices to be heard while maintaining complete anonymity and protection.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Principles
- **Managed Anonymity**: Hybrid model combining absolute technical security with professionally moderated interactions
- **Trauma-Informed Design**: Interface designed specifically for users who may have experienced trauma
- **Zero Digital Refoulement**: No collection of identifiable user data to prevent users from being "returned" to danger

## 📋 Use Cases

### Primary Workflows

1. **Anonymous Story Submission**
   ```
   User → Submit Story → Metadata Cleaning → AI Pre-moderation → 
   Human Review → Publication/Rejection
   ```

2. **Moderator Review Process**
   ```
   AI Analysis → Queue Assignment → Human Review → 
   Decision (Approve/Reject/Escalate) → Action
   ```

3. **Emergency Escalation**
   ```
   AI Detection → Emergency Flag → Priority Queue → 
   Crisis Protocol → Resource Provision
   ```
